codelist
===============================================================================

`codelist` is a package that should make it easier to work with code lists. A
code list is a set of codes with associated values. For example one could have
codes 'E' = 'Employed', 'U' = 'Unemployed', 'N' = 'Not belonging to the working
population' and 'X' = 'Unknown'.  Codes can also have a description, be
contained in a hierarchy and indicate specific types of missing values.

The package is still work in progress.
